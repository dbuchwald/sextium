Sextium is a simple computer emulator project. It was designed by Tomasz Wierzbicki, my teacher at University of Wroc≈Çaw, as a homework project for programming classes.

I haven't completed the assignment back then at the university and decided to work on it as a hobby project.

More details about the architecture will be provided later.
